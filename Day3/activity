HTML/CSS Activity/Homework

Objective:
Combining everything that we have learned in HTML and CSS, create a simple webpage using HTML elements and style it with CSS to introduce yourself. Showcase hobbies/interests by creatively presenting them in elements that you think will fit the best with your type of content.

Don't forget to section your code using semantic HTML!

Extra Mile (Optional):
If you're feeling extra, feel free to create multiple pages!

Link them together using hyperlinks (<a> tags). For example, you can create a separate page that enumerates the things you're into for your Hobbies section.

You can also add images and tables to make your Webpage more interesting!
